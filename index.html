<h3> Artist Statement</h3>
<p>My work is mainly graphics, I wish to pursue a career in graphic design after all. I like to do work that evokes emotion or shows a story. I want to create a connection between my work and the person who views it. Here is my current favorite song.<br><a href="https://youtu.be/N5Y1ZSLNLjM" target="_blank"> Enjoy!</a> </p>
